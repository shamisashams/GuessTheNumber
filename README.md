Initialization: The game starts by initializing the necessary variables, including the number to be guessed, guess count, and hints. 

Random Number Generation: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated. 

User Interaction: The user is prompted to guess the number. The input is validated to ensure it is a valid integer. 

Feedback: The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. Hints are given if the guess is close. 

Guess Recording: The user's guesses are recorded and saved to a text file. 

Termination: The game ends either when the user guesses correctly or runs out of attempts. The user is then prompted to play again or exit.
